I have to visit a large expo in havover germany with around 10000 exibits, I need to specifically pick my stalls to visit.<br> 
Purpose : I need to select companies that I can become a delaor or get associated with, for technical wing in india.<br>

## link to be scraped for information:
<https://www.hannovermesse.de/en/search/?category=ep> <br> **has around 8700 items**

## Conditions or filters : 
should not have thier presence in india. <br> **meaning** *: they should not have dealors in india or they should not have offices in india*

data to be written in a csv file or in google sheet

click on the website link and goto contact us page <br>
check if they have a indian dealor or office <br>

### can be done by looking for the word india
